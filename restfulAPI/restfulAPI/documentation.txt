Agenda> To build a service that will accept HTTP GET requests at http://localhost:8080/greeting
It would respond with JSON Representation of a greeting, as the following listing shows.
{"id":1,"content":"Hello, World!"}

Feature>
Customization using http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=User
The name parameter value overrides the default value of World and is reflected in the response as follows:
{"id": 1, "content":"Hello, User!"}


STEP 1: Initialized project through start.spring.io. Dependency choosed is Spring Web
STEP 2: Thought about some service interaction
STEP 3: GET Request for /greeting , return 200 OK Success status code -> Reponse with JSON with body that represents greeting
{
	"id":1,
	"content": "Hello, World"
}
STEP 4: To do this create a resource representation class 
	-> Create Greeting.java Record 
STEP 5: Create a Controller to handle HTTP requests , additional details are in the comments itself
STEP 6: RUN THE SPRINGBOOT main class and open the url http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=user or for default value use http://localhost:8080/greeting
